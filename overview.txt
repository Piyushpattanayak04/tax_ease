Project Overview
We propose a comprehensive cross-platform Tax Filing System to serve both individuals and businesses. This
system includes:
• Mobile application for Android and iOS (Client-side)
• Backend system for authentication, data storage, document upload, and workflow tracking
• Hosting, deployment, and post-launch support

Features & Modules
Client Panel (Mobile App - Flutter)
• User registration and login (with OTP/email verification)
• Multi-step Tax Filing Form for:
• T1 (Personal Tax Filing)
• Business Tax Filing
• Save as Draft / Continue Later option
• Document upload (PAN, Aadhar, Income Proof, etc.)
• Real-time status tracking (In Review, Filed, Completed, etc.)
• Downloadable summary of filing
• Support and query submission

Backend Services
• API Services (REST) using Node.js + Express
• Secure database (PostgreSQL or MongoDB)
• File upload with compression and antivirus scan (cloudflare)
• Email/SMS integration (if required)
• Admin & user authentication with password hashing and token auth

Data Privacy & Security
Given the sensitive nature of tax and personal data, we will ensure:
• End-to-end encryption of data during transit (HTTPS)
• Encrypted storage of sensitive fields using AES-256
• Password hashing using bcrypt with salt factor 12
• Optional refresh token hashing using SHA-256
• Role-based access control (RBAC) for user/admin
• File virus scanning upon upload
• Database backups & audit logging
• Token-based auth (JWT) and hashed passwords (bcrypt)
• Hosted on secure servers (Railway / Render) with SSL
• Secrets and keys managed securely via environment variables
• Optional integration of argon2 or PBKDF2 as alternative hashing methods for extra security layers
